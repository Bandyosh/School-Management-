# School-Management-

This is a program that allows you to manage student data for an entire school.

This program does not use maven or gradle to build the project, thus you need to have a jar of mysql avaiable and the code compilied to a .class file.

Then do `java -cp mysql.jar: Main` (Replace the mysql.jar with the name of the mysql file that you have available)

You need to also put in log in details for your mysql database within the Database file.
